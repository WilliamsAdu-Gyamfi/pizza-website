My project is a pizza menu website using only HTML and CSS. The homepage lists all pizzas with images, names, ingredients, and prices. I also included our working hours in a table and an 'About Us' section describing our mission. I used external CSS for layout and design.

The layout is responsive, clean, and structured using flex and grid
